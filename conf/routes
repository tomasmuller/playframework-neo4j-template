# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)

# Home page - we use the @controllers syntax here so that the router knows we are referring to a class.
# In turn, it will call on the GlobalSettings.getController method to resolve the actual controller instance.
GET     /                           @controllers.Application.index

# Map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets URL path
GET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)
